Umbraco 5 - Smallsite
=============

Idea
-------------
This should be a simple website created the most easy and efficient way possible. The website is using Umbraco 5, jQuery and HTML5.

So Far...
-------------

The current State is taht there is a  Home page with some Html displayed and an custom Contact Page with SurfaceController.

What's next?
-------------
* Categories and Products structures with corresponding pages.
* Facebook, Twitter, G+, Pinterest integrations for the Products
* GoogleMaps integration for the Contact Page


If you want to see what's up with the website you can use Username - 'administrator' and password 'admin123@' for logging in the Admin part of Umbraco.
