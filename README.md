Umbraco 5 - Smallsite
=============

Idea
-------------
This should be a simple website created the most easy and efficient way possible. The website should use Umbraco 5, jQuery and HTML5.

So Far...
-------------

The current State is:

* Boilerplate made with [Skeleton](http://www.getskeleton.com/)
* Home page with some Html displayed 
* Custom Contact Page with 'company info' and Input form made with with a SurfaceController
* GoogleMaps integration for the Contact Page
* Category and Product Document types with Templates with basic styling
* Using [ImageResizer](http://imageresizing.net) for making life a lot easier when working with images

What's next?
-------------
* Better styling of Category and Product pages
* Facebook, Twitter, G+, Pinterest integrations for the Products


If you want to see what's up with the website you can use Username - 'administrator' and password 'admin123@' for logging in the Admin part of Umbraco.


### Note: When you open the solution you must assign "Use IIS Express for development server" to the website because Umbraco runs only in IIS Express in Visual Studio.
